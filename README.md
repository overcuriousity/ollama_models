# ollama_models
My collection of Ollama Modelfiles I created for various use-cases I have.

To import a modelfile to Ollama using the command line, you can use the `ollama create` command. Here's how to do it:

1. First, save your modelfile to a text file. Let's assume you've saved it as `sausagerecipe.modelfile`.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the modelfile.

4. Run the following command:

```
ollama create sausagerecipe -f sausagerecipe.modelfile
```

Here's a breakdown of this command:
- `ollama create`: This is the command to create a new model in Ollama.
- `sausagerecipe`: This is the name you're giving to your new model. You can choose any name you like.
- `-f sausagerecipe.modelfile`: This flag specifies the file to use as the modelfile. Replace `sausagerecipe.modelfile` with the actual name of your file if it's different.

5. Ollama will then process the modelfile and create the new model. This may take some time depending on the size of the base model and any additional data you're including.

6. Once it's done, you can use your new model by running:

```
ollama run sausagerecipe
```

If you want to update an existing model with a new modelfile, you can use the same `create` command. Ollama will overwrite the existing model with the new configuration.
